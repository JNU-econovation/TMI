(2) in my off-hours i read, exercise, converse, study, garden, meditate, do <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=arty+things\">arty things</a>, and plan lots of projects that i only sometimes start and almost never finish.

(8) i have a contradictory blend of intense compassion and utter self-absorption. (9) i enjoy silence, but not in elevators. (10) i have been a beginning yoga student for 8 years.

(well maybe some intentional ones, like when i\\'m finger painting with chocolate pudding) if i like something, more is good, if not, there\\'s plenty else to try. i love being a girl and all that it entails. whether that means dressing up for a special event, or having full access to my emotions, i wouldn\\'t trade it. having a reason to dress up is a big pleasure, i also like a day in my pj\\'s every now and then.  i especially enjoy the unique polarity of masculine and feminine, it\\'s such a rich and unique alchemy. what i\\'m drawn to in a a man is his quiet confidence and his depth of presence. someone who\\'s comfortable enough in himself that he doesn\\'t need to pretend, posture, or impress, but can simply be the man that he is. secure enough that when he\\'s feeling something he can share it honestly. at home in his body and naturally affectionate. extra plus if you\\'re familiar with tantra and/or taoist practice.  my vision for my next relationship is one that is very dynamic, engaged, and a lot of fun. i\\'m drawn to connecting with those who are relatively free from the residue of their past so are free to live, act, and make decisions from today. we all have shadow, and one of it\\'s favorite places to show itself is in deeper relationship, but when there is space to welcome that, and even curiosity about it, i find it moves along pretty quickly.  i keep discovering that what matters most, is less about what i\\'m getting, than how i\\'m contributing, and i strive to have a positive impact whenever i can. i\\'m definitely an extrovert since i really enjoy people, i also need some down time to hang with myself.  although i love children, i\\'m probably not looking to have any, but i sure like playing with them. i wouldn\\'t rule out relationship with you if you\\'re a dad, so long as you\\'ve also got time and space for another significant relationship in your life.',\n",

       "  'essay0': \"ok, here's enough info to save us a bunch of emailing and a month of dating. i will lay it right out there exactly who i am and what i want. many men thank me for my clarity and frankness. i apologize for the length, but it's way faster in the long run. my time is precious and perhaps yours is as well. (feel free to skip over the section on books, films, food, etc. or any other section for that matter)  generally speaking, i am very content with myself and my life, yet i miss that special magic that two people can create together; and i really miss sharing the journey through life, and all the little and big ways that a relationship adds to my life.  on first dates, i'm often told that i'm really easy to talk with and very easy to be with. i suppose this is largely because i've grown quite comfortable with myself and who i am. i've worked on myself a lot for over 3 decades, and, while still/always a work-in-progress, i've come a long way in myself and in my life. i'm happy and i enjoy life. also, i have a lot of interests, i listen well and converse easily. i'm very curious about people and mostly non-judgmental.  those that know me describe me as very kind, feminine, extremely sweet, soft yet strong, gentle and firm, very present, calm, grounded, compassionate, lively, passionate, insightful, relaxed, very affectionate, interesting, super bright, curious, funny, multi-talented and creative, nurturing, generous, fun, and spontaneous...... though usually not all in the same sentence. i'm intense at times, but in a good way. men often ask me how it's possible that i'm unattached. those that know me really well would add that i'm wise, exceptionally sensitive, intuitive, and a bit of a sprite. you'll know i'm comfortable with you when you get to experience the sprite in me. :)  i have a huge heart and love full out. hopefully, you do too. that's where the 2heartsdelight happens. you'd need to be ok with being loved completely.  i have a very curious mind. i ask a lot of questions- not all of them aloud. i'm told i ask great questions. and, i don't have a need to always have conversation in the company of another. i'm fine with just being especially once we know each other a bit and are comfortable with each other.  i've developed awfully good communication skills and excellent relationship skills. men in recent years have found me rather remarkable in this way and in other ways too. i hold up my end of a partnership/relationship rather well and can let you have your experience w/o getting reactive and can manage my own experience w/o needing to process it with you. ideally, you're able to do the same. i'm past the point of needing to process a bunch of stuff in relationships. hopefully you are too. we'll process only that which needs to be processed together; the rest we'll each handle on our own. let's enjoy sharing the journey. harmony in relationship is absolutely paramount to me; life is short.  i'm a long time student (over 23 years) of the diamond approach in the ridhwan school and also of yoga. i have very very high integrity. i almost always take the high road- even in the worst of times. i'm iconoclastic, autodidactic, and very self-aware.  i live on the edge or beyond the edge of my comfort zone most of the time: my soul is on some sort of fast track. the rate of growth/transformation can be quite rapid; it's kind of out of my hands. i don't expect you to be like me in this regard, but you should know and understand this and be ok with it. i am not your average bear.  i'm realistic and i'm optimistic. i no longer sweat the small stuff and most things really are small stuff.  i am an independent thinker and think waaaay outside the box. visionary, creative, progressive,.....you get the idea.  my life is very full and fairly well-balanced; and i have plenty of time for the right man. in fact, it's a high priority for me to make time for a great man and create a great relationship together.  my spiritual life is quite significant, but the form is not rigid. i'm happier hiking, gardening, singing kirtan and bhajans, or going to a yoga class (all of those are spiritual for me) than going to church or temple although i can enjoy that too on occasion. my orientation to life is spiritual, has been my entire life and is well-integrated into my being so it's not critical for me to do spiritual things.  i'm quite self-sufficient, but much prefer partnership. i've gone from being super-competent, ultra-independent, feminist, do-everything-myself to being able to kindly ask for help, graciously accept it when it's offered, and be a feminine participant in the relationship. i'm very generous with the many feminine skills i possess. an ideal relationship for me has lots of mutual lavishing. interesting how when there's a lot of lavishing, there are very few issues....... :)  i know how to really accept another unconditionally and appreciate another fully. our chances for a really harmonious relationship increase tremendously if the same is true for you.  while having shared interests is nice, what is more important to me in a partner are kindness, self-acceptance, passion, respect, devotion to the relationship, personal responsibility, generosity, humor, lightness, fun, passion, honesty and openness. i offer all of these too.  i'm really comfortable with my sexuality as well as my libido. i'm also super affectionate and am extremely cuddly. if you are too, this could be delightful.  i'm active physically, love to hike, skate, walk, x/c ski, downhill too, snowshoe, swim, snorkel, love to dance- pretty much any kind of dance. if you'd be willing to take partner dance lessons, i'd be thrilled! i don't do any intense gym workouts, rock climb or do xtreme sports. and i'm not interested in competition.  i also enjoy quiet indoor time reading, writing, movies, sitting in front of the fire, and hanging out together, doing domestic stuff, cooking together, baking alone or together.  i'm told that although i'm quite mature, i have a youthfulness and appearance younger than my years. for this reason (and a few others), i stated my age 3 years younger than actual. people usually don't believe me when i tell them my age. really.  wrt the okc enneagram test, i am an unconventional 9 with an 8 wing; i am not an 8. i'd especially love to hear from men who are well-integrated 6s.  thanks for reading all the way through. i appreciate that it's a lot to read, but i find it saves us both a lot of time if we're really clear, self-revealing and specific.\",\n",

[finally, for those who may find this information important, i have not had a bank account in years and stopped filing/paying federal income taxes after the supreme court selected g.w. bush (p)resident in 2001 ( the irs stopped harassing me about four years ago, btw). federal income taxes on individuals have always been voluntary, they just go to great lengths to make you think you are statutorily required to fund their ever more corrupt madness.]  be well and enjoy the day!  the truth shall set us free. love is the only way forward.',\n",

(even so, i'm a republican. i do have a lot of conservative values, though not 100%. i'm adding this because many people assume i'm very liberal just because i live in berkeley. maybe if i'd lived somewhere like texas, iowa, or the east coast, i'd have had an easier time of meeting someone i'm compatible with.)  my former beau died of cancer almost two years ago, he was only 52 years old. so i'm kinda lonely.  i've lived quite an adventurous life, beginning with joining the air force at 19. i've seen a lot of the word. i lived in london &amp; paris... i'm a europhile, francophone.  i enjoy the simple things like just grocery shopping &amp; making a meal with someone special. i'm from the east bay but have seen much of the us... loved the south, nyc, and places in between.  *my hobbies include gardening, travel, reading, movies...  *a nice date might be going to the zoo (oakland, i'm a member), going on safari (they have one in sonoma california!), maybe going to the rennaisance faire. too, i often enjoy walking along the alameda beach.  *i prefer warm weather to cool, sacramento would be preferable to san francisco for a place to live.  *as far as dining out... i like a view! i'm not into fancy restraunts... often i'd prefer a picnic. of late i'm into health foods... i do still eat chicken, fish, &amp; some red meat. my late beau had a problem with alcohol, so i decided to give up drinking altogether. (i don't mind if someone drinks occasionally, but i'd just rather not be drinking these days.)  *some people have described me as aristocratic, i'm 4th generation in california and i've spent time living in london and paris. i have met some royalty... it was cool!!!  still, i've also been daddy's little girl &amp; enjoyed working on houses, driving a truck/ &amp; bus, using power tools, and going to the dump. i especially like bmws &amp; any kind of truck, especially with a lumber rack on it. i drive a subaru wagon these days.  *i spent many years in school. studies included: math-science, french, art-history-architecture, psychology (organizational behavior), &amp; i have an rn licence, a real estate licence, &amp; a commercial driver's licence (i drove a tour bus in san francisco for a time). work in tourism got me back to paris a half a dozen times (paid!) and i enjoyed using my french here for visitors from around the worldl.  * i enjoy a person who likes people, has a sense of humor, and can go to a morrocan restraunt &amp; the theater or the dump and enjoy them equally... a night in with a bbc mystery is also cool!!!  * i enjoy antiques, had an antique business for a short time... * i never married (came close a number of times), no kids, but i like children, small &amp; grown, as well as cats and dogs.  **** guess that's quite a bit about me, for starters... contact me if you'd like to meet and live within a reasonable distance. thx, sa*\",\n",

(ask me about the story of the sheep onboard the boat.... and how we got the sheep off the boat.) i am banned from riding a moped in two countries. i have made a traditional american feast on the african savanna over an open bonfire with nothing but some chopped beef and a machete.  i have not yet ventured into central america or asia much yet, but i hope to change that soon! also, i have always traveled alone.  i am \"a bit\" adventurous. i like to travel, planned or not, spur of the moment or not. i can hop on a flight to anywhere with no plans and be just fine. and i\\'ve done it. and i don\\'t mean to kansas. i mean to munich, zurich, or prague. when i flew to africa, i flew in without a plan and without knowing anyone. ended up living with a tribe and a rural preacher man and practicing emergency pediatric medical care out in the savanna and the wastes. one of the best experiences of my life.  edit: personality wise, i am no longer a dead split between an estp and an istp. i am a full-fledged istp. http://www.personalitypage.com/istp.html  i enjoy the great outdoors - hiking, camping, backpacking, canoeing, kayaking, sailing, skiing, snowboarding, swimming, caving, spelunking, exploring, etc. i like to be active.  i\\'m always dreaming about doing more. what can i do more? how can i help more? i like to volunteer and i have a huge desire to go back to school and get into the medical field (nurse, pa, something). one day, i\\'d like to practice high level medicine overseas. help out in places that need it most.  i am also a total nerd. give me some captain america, iron man, batman, or watchman any day. go avengers! love the movie and love the comic series. i was raised on the transformers and they\\'ll always have a very special place in my heart. hardcore scifi rocks my world  heinlein, asimov, bradbury, etc. star trek vs star wars? i can\\'t decide. i was raised on both. there are, however, only three star wars movies. only. three.  i am not a gamer myself, but i can enjoy watching people play games. i like the immersive experience, though due to my background in the government/military, i sometimes avoid the hyper realistic shooters. dead space and halo rock. i haven\\'t yet watched anyone play mass effect, to which i am told my life is woefully incomplete.  i am a christian and a devout believer in science. i marry the two together for a deeper and richer understanding of reality. can they be two sides of the same coin? studying and keeping up with emerging theories in quantum mechanics is one of my hobbies.  i am also a writer (both non-fiction and pop fiction). i\\'m working on several more little things, all in the adventure/sci-fi/military realm. recently i\\'ve become interested in branching out into a post-apocalyptic genre. or zombies.  i work out regularly and keep myself very well in shape.  i love sports. i enjoy watching and playing, especially football. yes, playing football. i joined an amateur men\\'s tackle football league in texas and played cb and safety. it was an amazing experience. i have a (small) scar on my face from the helmet, a scar on my shoulder from my shoulder pads, a healing crushed nerve in my elbow, and newly recovered torn quads in both legs. i almost broke my nose. my boss begged me to quit. i persevered. i made great tackles. :)  i am not a tree-hugging hippie.',\n",

       "  'essay0': 'i am disappointed at the lack of gender choices on this website. as a result, i often change my label (on here) between male and female. when i list myself as female, i label myself as gay because i\\'m sick of all the straight guys\\' disgusting one-liners. when i list myself as male, i label myself bisexual, but that\\'s only partly true. to find out why, read further.  if you installed <a href=\"http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/108791\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this script</a>, you\\'d be able to view my profile properly. the script will force okcupid to properly display my gender identity and sexuality at the top of my profile. (for those of you using the okc app on your smartphones, there is a link there that you can only see through a web browser.)  i used to think i was a woman trapped in a man\\'s body (transsexual), but i now realize that i just want people to treat me differently, in the body i\\'m in. my body isn\\'t the problem, everybody else\\'s perception of it is! i don\\'t identify as either male or female. i currently define myself as <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=intergendered\">intergendered</a>, although the broader terms &nbsp;<a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=genderqueer\">genderqueer</a> and \"<a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=non-binary%0agender\">non-binary gender</a>\" also fit. my preferred pronouns are neutral ones. they, them, zi, zir, or anything similar are all fine.  i\\'m too femme for most straight girls to be romantically and/or sexually attracted to me, and have the wrong genitals to be enjoyed by lesbians. this usually leaves me only able to date bisexual and pansexual people. i\\'m totally fine with only dating these people, i only wish there were more of them, as they are a clear minority. at times, the limited selection makes my romantic life rather difficult.  i always want to be friends before being lovers. i do not do one night stands, and try my best to avoid potentially short lived relationships. that being said, most of my friends are &nbsp;<a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=polyamorous\">polyamorous</a>, and so i tend to be polyamorish as well. i date around a lot, but what i\\'m really searching for is a relationship that will leave me so satisfied in and of itself that i won\\'t feel a desire to date other people even if i still have the option to. this is something that i know is out there for me; i just need to find the right person. (if you think we\\'d make good, platonic friends, don\\'t let this last paragraph keep you from writing to me!)  when i\\'m in a good mood, i\\'m generally very flirtatious. and when i do find somebody who i\\'m really attracted to, i have a tendency to get really giddy, which i personally rather enjoy, but it does have a tendency to make my attraction worry that things are moving too fast. it\\'s not uncommon for me to be compared to a flirtatious school girl.  i\\'m at a point in my life where i can\\'t have sex with anybody solely because i find them physically attractive. i\\'m almost a demisexual, except i\\'m just ignoring primary sexual attraction, and only looking for the secondary attraction. this is as opposed to not having primary attraction at all, like a true demisexual would. (for the definitions of demisexual, primary attraction, and secondary attraction, look here: http://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=demisexual)  back in the day, the first thing okc had you fill out was three adjectives that describe you. mine are, in no particular order, queer, pragmatic, and nurturing.  i hate money with a passion. there\\'s nothing fundamentally wrong with money, but the current system is so fucked up that it\\'s become merely a means of keeping the people currently on top in their places of power. i\\'m happy making just enough to get by, but i\\'d be happier with a more meaningful job (i\\'m actively looking).  in case you noticed that my religion says, \"other and somewhat serious about it,\" and you\\'re wondering about that, i\\'m a unitarian universalist. being serious about being a uu really doesn\\'t involve that much, since the main principles of the religion say that you can believe almost anything you want. around half of us don\\'t even believe in any deity, including myself. in short, i\\'m serious about peace, love, constructive debate, a constant desire to learn, and everybody getting along with everyone else.  i really am 6 feet tall, and on the skinny side of average. according to oktrends (http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating), most people lie about seemingly harmless little things, like their height, body condition, and income. i swear, to what ever it is that you believe in, that i have not told even the whitest of lies in my profile.  if you haven\\'t figured it out yet, my strategy for creating an online dating profile is to include as much about myself as possible in one. i believe that boundless honesty is essential in forming the most meaningful relationships, and that\\'s what i\\'m here for, so i\\'m trying to put as much out front as possible.  i used to act with cincinnati\\'s local rocky horror picture show cast, the denton affair. shadow acting, but still lots of fun. occasionally, i think about doing more stage work. so far though, i\\'ve only thought about it. rocky horror really aided in my self discovery.  for anyone that cares, i am a cancer-leo cusp. my birthday is right smack in between the two, and you won\\'t find more of a cusp than me. i don\\'t really think it matters, but some people seem to think this makes me extra awesome, so i won\\'t hold it against you if you do.  i\\'m a 2 on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kinsey_scale\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">kinsey scale</a>, if you assume that i\\'m male (the kinsey scale doesn\\'t work with non-binary genders). i\\'m totally not against cuddling and kissing the right kind of guy, but be aware that there will (probably) be no in-pants action going on! i suppose that this means that i am more &nbsp;<a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=heteroflexible\">heteroflexible</a> than bisexual. of course, the dilemma with this labeling is: how can i be \\'heteroflexible\\' if i don\\'t identify as either of the binary genders? but i have yet to find a more suitable label. the \"right kind of guy\" is, by the way, more often than not genderqueer, and effeminate, like myself.',\n",
